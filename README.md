# Predicting-Customer-Lifetime-Value
This Python script is trying to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not (the target variable) based on various features such as age, job, education, previous marketing campaign outcome, etc. The script first loads and visualizes the data to explore the relationship between different features and the target variable. Then it preprocesses the data by converting categorical variables to binary and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Finally, it fits and evaluates three different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression) to predict the target variable based on the given features. The evaluation is based on the mean squared error and R-squared values of the predicted results. The goal is to find the model with the smallest mean squared error and the highest R-squared value, which would indicate a better fit of the model to the data.
